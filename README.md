# Project-5

##Simulating the two-dimensional time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation

The project5 folder contains source code containing all cpp, python python codes to generate plots and animation. Thw aim in this project is to study the behavoiur of a quantum particle in a box by using the normalizes schrodiner equation. To do so, a series of experiments (the single-, double- and triple-slit) are performed using this simulations.
